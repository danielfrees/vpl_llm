    "# Notebook to work out the data pipeline for Michael's HF PRISM data -> VPL input \n",
    "\n",
    "General process from Michael's HF data -> the format needed for VPL:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Append prompt and response together with Human: {prompt}\\n\\nAssistant: {response}. Do this to create both `chosen` and `rejected` fields for the current turn (the preference pair we are trying to predict). \n",
    "2. Generate an 'Index' field. This should just be unique to the current row. \n",
    "3. Make a dummy `data_subset` called \"general\" for now. In the VPL work they use the data_subset for various visualizations. If we later do some analysis to cluster various types of prompt-response challenges in the PRISM data we can augment those here for further analysis. \n",
    "4. Map the prompt only to `prompt` field. \n",
    "5. Map the two responses in order to `responses` field, a List[str]. \n",
    "6. If the first response in the `responses` field was the preferred response, set `original_label`: 0 and `label`: 0. Otherwise set both to 1. \n",
    "7. Map `objective` to the same thing as `data_subset`. \n",
    "8. Set `controversial` to False as a dummy fill-in. I believe in the original paper this was marked for further analysis to emphasize that VPL works better on examples asking controversial/split responses, e.g. comparing cats vs dogs to be better in the pets dataset. The exact definition is left unclear in the OG paper. \n",
    "9. Use a similar framework as in `vpl_llm/hidden_context/data_utils/data_processing.generate_embeddings_with_llm()` to generate embeddings for the `chosen` and `rejected` ($s_A$ and $s_B$, respectively, with $[p,r]$ (prompts and responses concatenated). This is essential mapping the `chosen` and `rejected` fields from (1) to a hidden encoded state from the chosen pre-trained LLM (such as GPT2/ llama3). Map these to `embeddings` as a Dict[str, List[float]], where in the dictionary we have keys `embedding_chosen` with value = the LLM embedding of `chosen`, and the same for `embedding_rejected`.)\n",
    "10. Create a `context_length` which is the length of the NEW FIELD `contexts`. This will NOT match the length of the original `contexts` field in Michael's data, as that is a list of each and every turn (prompt, response, prompt, response, prompt) etc., always ending with the current turn's prompt. Rather, the new contexts field will contain embeddings for previous `embedding_chosen` and `embedding_rejected` for the current user. In the (prompt, response, prompt, response, prompt) example, this means we should expect the NEW `context_length` to be 2, since we will include the two prior $[p,r]$ turn encoding dictionaries. For more details, see (11). \n",
    "11. Create a NEW `contexts` field. Each item in the `contexts` field will contain the keys `embedding_chosen`, `embedding_rejected`, and `original_id` (I think this `original_id` is just the row ID of the example used to create `embedding_chosen` and `embedding_rejected`). This is the field to be most careful in creating. + there are some hyperparameters to experiment with here, down the line. For all prior turns in the conversation (1 prior turn minimum, we will opt to NOT predict the first turn, based on other preferences for the same turn as that feels leaky to me (/IS leaky)), we can use ALL 5 choose 2 preference pairs in the dataset and add those to the NEW `contexts` list, or we can just choose the favorite vs. least favorite response (or fav vs. 2nd most fav response) from each prior turn. We can also sample prior turns when there have been many turns to minimize the length and 'soupiness' of the contexts. All of these will affect the learning of the Pair Encoder and Sequential Encoder in the VPL architecture and are thus important choices. So long as we only use embedding pairs from previous (chronologically) turns for the given conversation and user (or from any point in another conversation with this user), then we are not leaking data into the contexts.

This has attracted research interest from anthropological demographers.\\n\\n- Studies have looked at the transformation from an agrarian to industrial society and its impacts on family structures, gender roles, marriage patterns, fertility rates, and aging. The speed and scale of these changes are unprecedented. \\n\\n- The baby boom after the Korean War, followed by a rapid decline in fertility rates starting in the 1980s, has shaped population dynamics. Researchers have tried to understand the social and cultural factors behind these shifts.\\n\\n- Urbanization has profoundly altered kinship networks and intergenerational relationships traditionally centered around the extended family. Studies examine how people maintain family ties amid physical distance.\\n\\n- Issues around low birth rates, aging, multigenerational households, sandwich generation caregivers, and changing gender dynamics in the family have all been topics of demographic anthropological inquiry.\\n\\n- Comparisons are often made with other East Asian societies also experiencing demographic transitions, highlighting both shared cultural influences and divergent national experiences.\\n\\n- More recent research has also focused on immigrant populations in', 'role': 'model'}\n",

      "{'content': 'Here are some key points about fertility rates and trends among Christian Koreans in South Korea:\\n\\n- Christian Koreans historically had higher fertility rates than the national average, due to more traditional family values promoted by churches.\\n\\n- However, their rates have been declining in recent decades, converging closer to replacement level (2.1 children per woman) like the general population.\\n\\n- In the 1970s, Christian Korean fertility was estimated to be around 3-4 children per family. By the 2000s, it had fallen to around 1.5-2 children.\\n\\n- Scholars attribute this to increased education and employment among Christian Korean women, delaying marriage and childbearing. Urbanization also disrupted traditional family structures.\\n\\n- Protestant Christians still tend to have slightly higher rates than Catholics or the non-religious. Rates also vary between denominations - more conservative churches see higher fertility.\\n\\n- Fertility is higher in rural Christian communities compared to urban ones, where modern trends like small families are stronger. \\n\\n- Government incentives and cultural shifts toward smaller families have influenced reproductive choices across religious groups in South Korea.\\n\\n- Overall, Christian Korean fertility is steadily declining but remains above replacement level in some rural/conservative church', 'role': 'model'}\n",

Many left during economic hard times in the past.\\n\\n- Fertility data on returning diaspora is limited, but studies suggest their rates are generally higher than the native South Korean population. \\n\\n- For example, rates among Chinese Koreans who returned in the 1990s-2000s were around 1.7-2 children per woman - above the national average of 1.2-1.3 at the time.\\n\\n- Cultural factors from their home countries may influence a preference for larger families compared to native South Koreans.\\n\\n- However, returning diaspora fertility is declining over generations as they integrate fully into South Korean society. Their children born in Korea have even lower rates.\\n\\n- Location also impacts rates - those settling in urban areas see a faster drop in fertility compared to rural returnees.\\n\\n- Access to public policies and benefits for families upon return may help support slightly higher fertility among recent diaspora immigrants.\\n\\n- Overall the data suggests returning diaspora have a \"in-between\" fertility pattern', 'role': 'model'}\n",
